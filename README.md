# Discendo
 
## Project Goal
The goal of Discendo is to create an education platform for students and learners worldwide to identify specific weakpoints and improve. Furthermore, the project seeks to close the gap between disadvantaged students and their peers by offering a conditional finance plan allowing all students the oppertunity to advance their educational pathway.

## Features (Existing and Planned)
In it's current state, Discendo features a simple yet secure login system, a quiz creator and an overall quiz taking system. These form the base foundations of the website, with the login system designed for future implementation of private quizzes for individual groups like schools, a verification system for creating quizzes, a platform to help support the planned subscription based model and more. 
The quiz creator is a way for users to create new quizzes for the general public and for private usecases with only the former currently implemented. In future iterations, the quiz creation system will be used to create an internal job ecosystem with their creators being payed out for public quizzes depending on their popularity and userbase. This once again helps close the gap by giving students valuble work experience and a potential source of income, both of which are immensly valuable in today's world. 
Lastly there's the actual quiz taking system, to start there's a rudimentry quiz display system which is currently only sorted by date of creation but will be expanded with filters and multiple sorting options to help assist with finding what you need. The system also includes the actual core testing system which will be expanded to include automatic data analytics to locate weak points in your understanding and helps provide options to fill them in.

## Target Audience and Financial Model
While we admit there is heavy competition within the education space, many existing alternatives fail to adknowledge the wider student base and how many suffer financial challenges. As such we differ ourselfs from the competition by offering conditional finance plans where families and schools can apply and depending on the situation can get anywhere from a 20% off discount to a free premium service. As well as helping close the gap between disadvantaged groups, this also helps make Discendo a main stream product and more appealing to other students to try and eventually, more appealing to schools and communities who are intended to be our main source of revenue. We intend to offer both individual subscriptions and community subscriptions which come with the conditional offers. 
We'll additionally offer a free service with ads, with a focus on ensuring that they do not pause your learning. This means that they will only ever appear on the side of tasks and not force to watch or wait. Additionally the free service will be limited in that they will only be able to create quizzes for personal use and will be unable to share them to the wider public. Among other reasons, this serves as the first wall of defense against malicous attacks targetting our service by creating offensive or dangerous items.
